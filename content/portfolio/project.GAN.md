This project explored the theoretical properties of generative adversarial networks, regarding their convergence.

- We analyzed the conditions under which GANs converge to an equilibrium, ensuring that the generator learns to produce realistic data distributions.
- We studied a specific cases of mode collapse, where the generator fails to capture the full diversity of the data, and showed the mathematical theorems. 

### Toolkit for the project
