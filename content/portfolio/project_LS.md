This is a project on joint modeling of truncated longitudinal data and survival data using a couple of survival models,
Weibull Regression Model and Loglogistic Accelerated Failure Time Model. 

- We developed a statistical model for hierarchical joint mean structures with parametric approaches.
- We designed the model to handle complex hierarchical data structures and estimate joint mean relationships.
- We implemented and tested various optimization techniques to improve model performance and accuracy.
- We conducted detailed simulations and data analysis to evaluate the model's effectiveness.
- We wrote a comprehensive report detailing the design, implementation, and results of the model.

### Source code

- We developed R implementation in Github Repository [parametric-hhjms](https://github.com/jiapivialiu/parametric-hhjms).

### Toolkit for the Project

- R language.
- R packages: tidyverse, batchtools, etc.
- R Studio, VScode.
- LaTex.
