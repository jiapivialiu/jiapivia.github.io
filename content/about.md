I'm currently a PhD candidate in Statistics working with [Dr. Daniel J. McDonald](https://dajmcdon.github.io/) at the University of British Columbia.  
I have a passion for research in statistics and machine learning. My research areas are **computational statistics**, **nonparametric regression**, and **convex optimization**. 
My current focus is on leveraging data-driven methods to solve complex problems, including reproduction number estimation.

I started doing the PhD program in September, 2020 and became a PhD candidate on June 13, 2023. 
Before this, I did my Master of Science in Mathematics and Statistics Concentration in Statistics with [Dr. Maia Fraser](https://mysite.science.uottawa.ca/mfrase8/) at the University of Ottawa during 2018--2020. 
I did my undergraduate in Economic Statistics at Zhejiang University of Finance and Economics, Zhejiang, China between 2014 and 2018. 

In addition to my academic pursuits, Iâ€™m also an ACE-certified personal trainer. I enjoy weightlifting, indoor cardio with boxing, treadmill or elliptical machine, outdoor cardio like hiking, food-hunting, karaoke, bartending and traveling.
