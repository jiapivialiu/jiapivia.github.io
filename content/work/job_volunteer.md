I worked with many amazing peers on exploring and translating English big data-related articles into Chinese between October, 2019 and October, 2020. 

- I collaborated with a diverse team of peers to identify key topics in big data, engaging in discussions to select articles that would be beneficial for the Chinese-speaking audience.

- I translated complex technical content from English to Chinese, ensuring accuracy and clarity while also localizing the material to make it culturally relevant and accessible to the target audience.

- I conducted thorough reviews and revisions of translated articles to maintain high standards of language quality and technical integrity, incorporating feedback from team members and subject matter experts.

- I participated in regular team meetings to discuss challenges and share insights gained from the translation process, contributing to a collective understanding of big data trends and innovations.

- I compiled and organized a glossary of key terms and concepts in both languages to facilitate consistency in terminology across translations, supporting future translation efforts within the team.
