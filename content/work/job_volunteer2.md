I co-organized with a couple of fellow graduate students the graduate student seminars at [SGSA](https://ubc-stat-grad.github.io), Department of Statistics, UBC.

- We organized and scheduled seminar sessions, ensuring they aligned with the academic calendar and accommodate guest speakers and attendees.

- We invited and coordinated with guest speakers, faculty members, and fellow students, handling communication and logistical arrangements.

- We created promotional materials and announcements to raise awareness of upcoming seminars, utilizing departmental email lists, social media, and bulletin boards.

- We selected relevant topics and themes for seminars based on current research trends, student interests, and department goals.

- We ensured all necessary technology (e.g., projectors, microphones, virtual meeting platforms) was available and functioning for each seminar.

- We moderated the seminars, guiding discussions, and encouraging participation from attendees to foster an interactive environment.

- We gathered feedback from participants after each seminar to assess the effectiveness of the sessions and made improvements for future events.

- We maintained records of seminar topics, speakers, attendance, and feedback to help with planning future seminars and reporting to the department.

- We created opportunities for networking among students, faculty, and guest speakers, fostering connections and collaborations within the department.
