👏🎊 I'm thrilled to announce that my first research paper **"rtestim: Time-varying reproduction number estimation using trend filtering"** has just been officially released! 📊 

🔍 This work proposed a method, which is implemented in the R package [*rtestim*](https://dajmcdon.github.io/rtestim/), for accurate and computationally efficient estimation of the instantaneous reproduction number, a crucial metric for understanding the spread of infectious diseases.

You can read the full paper [here](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012324).

I'm incredibly proud of this work and would love to hear your thoughts and feedback. A big thank you to my collaborators and everyone who supported me throughout this journey! 🙏🌟
