## About Me

I'm currently a PhD candidate in Statistics working with [Dr. Daniel J. McDonald](https://dajmcdon.github.io/) at the University of British Columbia. My research areas are computational statistics, nonparametric regression, and convex optimization. I started doing the PhD program in September, 2020 and became a PhD candidate on June 13, 2023. Before this, I did my master in statistics with [Dr. Maia Fraser](https://mysite.science.uottawa.ca/mfrase8/) at the University of Ottawa during 2018--2020. I did my undergraduate in Economic Statistics at Zhejiang University of Finance and Economics, Zhejiang, China between 2014 and 2018.
